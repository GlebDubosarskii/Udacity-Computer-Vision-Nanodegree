# Landmark Detection

In this project, I implement SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) in the case of a robot located on a 2D map.  Sensor and motion data gathered by the simulated robot are used to create a map of an environment. SLAM gives us a way to track the location of the robot in the world and identify the locations of landmarks such as buildings, trees, etc.
